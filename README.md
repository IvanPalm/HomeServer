## Introduction

This document outlines the steps to set up and configure my home server. The services included aim to provide a comprehensive solution for file management, media streaming, content organization5, and personal cloud functionality. Each service is run in a containerized environment for easy deployment and management.

---

## Server Configuration

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- **Hardware**: Lenovo IdeaPad U430
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Non-root admin user with sudo permissions.
  - Docker and Docker Compose installed.

---

## Networking

For the first connection, use passwork-based access from the admin user on the server.

### Install and Set Up UFW

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a simple and effective way to secure your server by managing incoming and outgoing traffic.

1. **Install UFW** (if not already installed):  

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ufw
   ```

1. **Set Default Rules**:  
   Configure UFW to deny all incoming traffic by default and allow all outgoing traffic:  

   ```bash
   sudo ufw default deny incoming
   sudo ufw default allow outgoing
   ```

1. **Allow SSH**:  
   Specify the port for SSH to ensure you don't lock yourself out of the server:  

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   ```

1. **Enable UFW**:  
   Activate the firewall with the specified rules:  

   ```bash
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

1. **Verify Configuration**:  
   Check which ports are allowed and ensure the firewall is active:  

   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

This setup provides basic protection, restricting access to only the specified ports. Be sure to configure additional rules for any other services you intend to expose.

Hereâ€™s the summarized and formatted markdown for the instructions:

### Configure SSH Key Authentication and Fail2Ban

1. **Generate an SSH Key Pair**

On your client machine, generate a secure SSH key pair:  

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096"
```

1. **Copy Public Key to Server**

Transfer the public key to the server. Replace `<YOURNAME>`, `<SERVER-IP>`, and `<PORT>` with your username, server IP, and SSH port, respectively:  

```bash
scp -P <PORT> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <USER>@<SERVER-IP>:/home/<USER>/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- If the `authorized_keys` file already exists, append the public key on a new line.

1. **Enable Key-Based Login Only**

Edit the SSH configuration file to allow only key-based authentication:  

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Update the following lines:  

```yml
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
```

Restart the SSH daemon to apply changes:  

```bash
sudo service sshd restart
```

### Install and Configure Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban helps protect against brute-force attacks by banning IPs with repeated failed login attempts.

1. **Install Fail2Ban**:  

   ```bash
   sudo apt install fail2ban
   ```

1. **Create a Local Configuration**:  
   Copy the default configuration to a new `.local` file:  

   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local
   ```

1. **Set Up an SSH Jail**:  
   Add the following to the end of `/etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local`:  

   ```ini
   [sshd]
   enabled = true
   port = 549
   filter = sshd
   logpath = /var/log/auth.log
   maxretry = 3
   bantime = -1
   ```

   - **Note**: `bantime = -1` bans indefinitely. Adjust as needed.

1. **Restart Fail2Ban**:  

   ```bash
   sudo service fail2ban restart
   ```

1. **Check Fail2Ban Status**:  
   View the status of the SSH jail:  

   ```bash
   sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
   ```

1. **Unban an IP Address**:  
   If needed, unban a specific IP:  

   ```bash
   sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP-ADDRESS>
   ```

This configuration secures your server by enforcing key-based authentication and adding brute-force protection.

### Setting Up a Custom Domain on Namecheap

1. **Domain Registration**:
   - Register custom domain on [Namecheap][namecheap_main].

2. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Configured `AAAA` record assigned to homeserver public IPv6, setting host to `@`.
   - TODO: Set up subdomains for services (e.g., `nextcloud.myhomeserver.com`).

3. **Dynamic DNS**:
   - Configured `ddclient` as per [Namecheap guide][namecheap_ddclient].
   - Set `run_damenon=true` in `/etc/default/ddclient` for ddclient to run as a daemon.
   - TODO: Figure out issues with port forwarding and CGNAT.

4. **SSL Certificates**:
   - TODO: Set up HTTPS for all services using Let's Encrypt or similar tools.
